ðŸ’– What programming languages I like
As a frontend developer most of my time I write JavaScript. But in my free time I am trying to build some projects in the backend as well. On serverside I use Node.js most of the time because why don't use javascript on backend? ðŸ˜Ž

Java and Python are always fun to code with. Especially when trying to solve algorithm/ds problems ðŸ˜‰
